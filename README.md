This repository holds the code for my personal website - a simple single-page app which lets you flick through some of my Flickr photographs.

You can see it in action here: http://benjaminelliott.co.uk/ 

This app was made using:

* Angular 2 (with AOT compilation)
* TypeScript 2
* Webpack 2
* Sass
* PostCSS/Autoprefixer
